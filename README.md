# PiggyBank 

Make a PiggyBank.sol contract that accepts ether and only pays out when a savings goal is reached
* Set savings goal in the constructor
* Make a payable deposit() function   
* Make a withdrawal() function that pays out only once goal is reached

Using the “User Accounts” example and the “Call a contract function” example, deposit ether to 
the PiggyBank from Alice’s account.  Withdraw once the savings goal is reached.

Bonus
withdrawal() only pays to the contract creator  (hint - truffle deploys from web3.eth.accounts[0] )
